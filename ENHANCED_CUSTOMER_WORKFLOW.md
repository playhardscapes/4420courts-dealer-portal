# Enhanced Customer System - Complete Workflow Guide

## üè¢ Customer-Centric Architecture Overview

The enhanced customer system supports complex business relationships with municipalities, HOAs, schools, and businesses where you need to manage:
- Multiple contacts (decision makers, billing departments, on-site coordinators)
- Separate addresses (billing/admin offices vs. physical project locations)
- Organization-specific requirements (PO numbers, approvals, access procedures)

## üìã Complete Workflow Examples

### Example 1: Municipality Project (Botetourt County)

#### Step 1: Customer Creation
```typescript
Customer: {
  companyName: "Botetourt County Parks & Recreation",
  organizationType: "MUNICIPALITY",
  
  // Primary decision maker
  primaryContact: {
    name: "John Smith",
    title: "Parks & Recreation Director", 
    email: "jsmith@botetourtva.gov",
    phone: "540-473-8246"
  },
  
  // Separate billing department
  billingContact: {
    name: "Mary Johnson",
    title: "Accounts Payable Clerk",
    email: "mjohnson@botetourtva.gov",
